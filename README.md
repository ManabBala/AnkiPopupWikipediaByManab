# AnkiWikiPopup
Anki 2.1 addon to display Wikipedia page previews inside of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).



Shows a popup of the Mobile Wikipedia page / Extract for the selected text. In order to avoid conflicts with the Popup-Dictionary addon, this addon only supports keyboard shortcuts (Control-Shift-W) for now. 


#### Mode:
| Mobile (default)             |  Extract (shorter, faster to load) |

### Features

- Popup of either full mobile pages, or shorter extracts
- page caching to speed up repeated searches
- Multilanguage support - change the language in `config.json` with the language [as per list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias#List).

This addon currently in beta stage - things will almost certainly break! Please submit a bug report if it does.

### Known issues

- Clicking on links inside the popup opens the browser, *but with the wrong URL*
- Disambiguation pages are not handled well
- Does not work with NightMode due to the way Night-Mode monkeypatches Reviewer.revHtml, see [this github issue here](https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-Night-Mode/issues/53)
- Currently does not play nicely with Popup Dictionary. Currently trying to figure this out!

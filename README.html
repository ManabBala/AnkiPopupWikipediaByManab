<b>AnkiWikiPopup</b>

Anki 2.1 addon to display Wikipedia page previews inside of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>.

Shows a popup of the Mobile Wikipedia page / Extract for the selected text. In order to avoid conflicts with the
Popup-Dictionary addon, this addon only supports keyboard shortcuts <b>(Control-Shift-W)</b> for now.

<b>Modes:</b>
Mobile (default)

Extract (shorter, faster to load)

<b> Features </b>
<ul>
    - Popup of either full mobile pages, or shorter extracts
    - page caching to speed up repeated searches
    - Full HTML popups with images
</ul>

This is currently in beta stage - things will almost certainly break! Please submit a bug report if it does.

<b> Known issues</b>

<ul>
    - Clicking on links inside the popup opens the browser, but with the wrong URL
    - Disambiguation pages are not handled well
    - Does not work with NightMode due to the way Night-Mode monkeypatches Reviewer.revHtml, see <a
        href="https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-Night-Mode/issues/53">this github issue here</a>
    - Currently does not play nicely with Popup Dictionary. Currently trying to figure this out!
